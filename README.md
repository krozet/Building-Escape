# Building-Escape-Game

Simple premise: escape the room. Utilizes ray casting, trigger volumes, C++ code communicating with Blueprint, and collisions.

My first game made in UE4 - it is a small step towards greater understanding.

This was created with the help of the Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy.

Enjoy,
